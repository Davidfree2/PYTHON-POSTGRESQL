Hey! thanks for checking out my postgresql/python project

This requires the installation of postgreSQL and python

Here ive created a finance tracker, type in what tye item is called,price, and date of purchase and itll all be saved in a postgre Sql database. From there you can view,alter,insert,delete from your database!
